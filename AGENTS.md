# AGENTS.md — Hand-off guide for AI agents working on eos_core

You are working on **Eos Core**, a Frappe v16 re-implementation of **Ninety.io** (the EOS operating
system software). This file exists so you can start contributing without re-discovering the repo.
Read `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` after this file.

## Ground rules (hard constraints from the product owner)

1. **Never write code comments or docstrings** in Python or JavaScript files you create or modify.
   State intent in the docs (`docs/*.md`) and via clear naming.
2. Do not change the DocType names `EOS Metric`, `Scorecard Entry`, or the `entries` Table field.
   Product terminology mapping to Ninety is described in `docs/architecture.md`.
3. After editing any `*.json` schema, run `bench migrate` and verify the DocType synced.
4. **This is a Ninety clone, so match Ninety.** When a behaviour is ambiguous, resolve it by
   checking Ninety's documented behaviour — not by picking the tidier design, and not by asking
   again. These five questions are already settled; do not re-open them:
   - **UI last.** Build order is correctness → parity → **permissions** → UI.
   - `compute_health` was deleted: it encoded a 10%-tolerance colour Ninety never shows.
   - `To Do.todo_name` carries a real `unique` DB index.
   - "View by" is a **read-only projection** over the existing `Scorecard`, not a new DocType.
   - **Empty completed intervals count against** the status indicator.

## Start here

Read in this order, then work from the queue in `docs/TODO.md`:

1. This file — rules, commands, gotchas, and the execution workflow below.
2. `docs/TODO.md` — **the only live work queue**. Pick the top `TODO` item and follow its
   "Done when" line.
3. `docs/execution/<TODO-ID>.md` — **if the item you picked has one**, that is your plan. See
   *Executing work* below.
4. `docs/roadmap.md` — phase history and the audit behind the queue.
5. `docs/architecture.md` — domain model, engine contract, terminology mapping.
6. `eos_core/scorecard_engine.py` — frappe-free pure logic; the home for all new pure functions.

Never rely on a "DONE" marker in `roadmap.md` to mean a feature is usable — that marker only ever
meant "the code exists and is unit-tested".

## Executing work

`docs/TODO.md` and `docs/execution/` answer different questions, and the split is the point.

- **`docs/TODO.md` is the work queue.** It says what is outstanding, at what severity, in what order.
  It is never a task list of small steps, and a micro-task must never be promoted to a new queue
  item. IDs are stable and are never renumbered or deleted.
- **`docs/execution/<TODO-ID>.md` is the decomposition of one item.** Large items are too big for one
  context window, so each has a plan whose tasks are each small enough to understand, inspect,
  implement, test and verify in a single session. `docs/execution/README.md` is the index and the
  conventions.

Rules for a session that starts work:

1. **Select the top unblocked `TODO` item** by the queue's own rules: work the blocks in order,
   within a block S1 first, and never start an item whose stated dependency is still open. Severity
   is triage, not order, and neither is a licence to reorder the queue.
2. **Check the context budget before picking a task, not during one.** Compaction fires at 70% of the
   window, and that is a cliff rather than a slope: whatever was in flight in the last 30% is what
   gets summarised away, and it will be the half-finished edit. So **start a task at 30% or above,
   and do not start one that cannot finish below 70%.** That is a ~40%-of-window budget, which fits a
   DocType-level task from the plans and does not fit `UI-1.2`. When in doubt, **one task per
   session** — five tasks in a session means five sets of file reads compounding, and the fifth is
   the one that dies. Start fresh instead; the plan's `## Current Task` and the last commit are the
   handoff, and a fresh session at 0% can do one task properly where a chained one cannot.
3. **If the item has an execution plan, follow it.** Read the whole file first, then continue the
   task named in its `## Current Task` section. That section is the resume point — a new session
   should never have to guess which task was in flight. Do not re-read `roadmap.md` or
   `architecture.md` up front; read the parts the current task actually touches. The canonical
   opening prompt for a fresh session is in `docs/execution/RESUME.md`.
4. **If the item has no execution plan, it is small enough to do in one session** straight from its
   `TODO.md` text. Do not create a plan for it.
5. **Work one task at a time and finish it before starting the next.** A half-finished task plus a
   half-finished second one is what forces context compaction, which is exactly what the plans exist
   to prevent.
6. **Do not deliberately approach the context limit.** If a task is going to need one, **stop and
   split it first** — add `UI-1.4a` / `UI-1.4b` to the plan, give each its own acceptance criteria
   and verification, point `## Current Task` at the first, and record why under `## Discovered
   Issues`. Splitting is a normal outcome, not a failure. Carrying a large task into compaction is.
7. **Commit at every task boundary**, even a partial one, with the task ID in the message
   (`UI-1.2: ...`). This is the strongest of all these rules and it depends on nobody remembering
   anything: a commit is ground truth that survives compaction, so the next session can reconstruct
   where it is from `git log` alone rather than trusting a plan file to be accurate.
8. **Persist state as you go.** After each task: set its `Status` to `DONE`, paste the real
   verification output into `## Completed`, and advance `## Current Task`. A future session must be
   able to resume from the file alone, with no memory of this one.
9. **Run the task's verification before marking it done, and paste the result.** "Should work" is
   not a result. Where a task changes behaviour, confirm the test fails without the change. A
   `*.json` edit — including a `permissions` block — needs `bench migrate` before the tests mean
   anything.
10. **Mark a queue item complete only after every clause of its "Done when" is verified**, with the
   run's real output as evidence. `code+tests` and `reachable` are separate boxes and both must be
   ticked. If only part of an item landed, say which part in `TODO.md` rather than closing the item.
11. **Do not start unrelated work.** Found a bug, a stale doc or a missing item while working? Give it
   a new `TODO.md` ID and record it under `## Discovered Issues` in the plan. Fixing it "while I am in
   here" is how a session ends up with a commit that mixes two things. The one exception is a
   prerequisite the plan itself names.
12. **Never re-open a settled decision.** The five locked Ninety-parity decisions are in § Ground
    rules. Where a plan's *Decisions to settle* is a real open question, resolve it from Ninety's
    documented behaviour and write the answer down — do not design it from the tidier option.

## Environment

- Bench root: `frappe-bench` (this app lives at `apps/eos_core`).
- Sites: `resolv.localhost` (has `frappe`, `resolv`, and **`eos_core`** installed — run everything
  here), `development.localhost` (frappe only).
- App is installed on `resolv.localhost` only. If you add a new site, install eos_core there before
  migrating.
- Database: MariaDB. All DocTypes are standard (InnoDB) tables.

## Commands (run from `frappe-bench/`)

```bash
bench --site resolv.localhost migrate                    # sync schema changes
bench --site resolv.localhost install-app eos_core       # first-time install (unnecessary now)
bench --site resolv.localhost execute <path.to.function> --kwargs '{"k":"v"}'   # run one-off
bench --site resolv.localhost console                    # interactive shell (pipable for tests)
bench --site resolv.localhost list-doctypes -a           # confirm DocType is registered
bench run-tests --app eos_core --site resolv.localhost   # full suite (248)
bench run-tests --module eos_core.test_permissions --site resolv.localhost   # permission layer alone
```

Example one-off execution of the scoring engine:

```bash
bench --site resolv.localhost execute eos_core.scorecard_engine.compute_status \
  --kwargs '{"target_value": 100, "actual_value": 80, "operator": ">="}'
```

Run one test module while iterating (much faster than the whole suite):

```bash
bench --site resolv.localhost run-tests \
  --module eos_core.eos_core.doctype.scorecard_report.test_scorecard_report
```

Test the pure engine with no site or frappe import at all (~1s, no DB):

```bash
cd /workspace/development/frappe-bench && ./env/bin/python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'apps/eos_core')
from eos_core.scorecard_engine import compute_status
print(compute_status(100, 0, '<='))"
```

Read-only DB introspection — pipe a script into the console:

```bash
cat > /tmp/q.py <<'EOF'
print("IDX:", frappe.db.sql("show index from `tabTo Do` where Key_name != 'PRIMARY'"))
EOF
bench --site resolv.localhost console < /tmp/q.py
```

Note `bench execute /tmp/q.py` does **not** work — Frappe resolves the argument as an app module
and raises `AppNotInstalledError`. Use the console for ad-hoc SQL.

Tests: `bench --site resolv.localhost run-tests --app eos_core` runs the whole suite in one go —
**185 integration + 63 pure-engine unit = 248 tests**, all green (needs `allow_tests true`, already
enabled on `resolv.localhost`). The split by file:

| Integration test | Count |
|---|---|
| `eos_core/test_permissions.py` (30 hand-written + 66 generated) | 96 |
| `eos_core/test_roles.py` (roles provisioning — touches the DB) | 4 |
| `doctype/eos_metric/test_eos_metric.py` | 12 |
| `doctype/issue/test_issue.py` | 5 |
| `doctype/level_10_meeting/test_level_10_meeting.py` | 7 |
| `doctype/quarterly_review/test_quarterly_review.py` | 5 |
| `doctype/rock/test_rock.py` | 5 |
| `doctype/scorecard/test_scorecard.py` | 19 |
| `doctype/scorecard_report/test_scorecard_report.py` | 15 |
| `doctype/player/test_player.py` | 4 |
| `doctype/team/test_team.py` | 4 |
| `doctype/to_do/test_to_do.py` | 5 |
| `doctype/vto/test_vto.py` | 4 |
| **Integration total** | **185** |
| `eos_core/test_scorecard_engine.py` (unit, frappe-free) | **63** |
| **Total** | **248** |

The 185 covers every suite that needs a database, `test_roles.py` included — Frappe's runner counts
it as integration, so it belongs in that block. (Corrected 2026-09-29: the table previously listed
`test_roles.py` *below* the 180 total, so its rows summed to 176 and did not reconcile.)

Re-derive these with `grep -rc 'def test_'` rather than trusting the table — the documented totals
have drifted more than once. `test_permissions.py` is the one file where that method undercounts by
a lot: 30 in the source, 96 in the run, because it generates
`test_visibility_<doctype>_<role>` for 11 DocTypes × 6 roles. `test_roles.py` is the other: 4 either
way. The **total** is the number to trust.

**Permissions are implemented.** The six Ninety roles are created by
`after_migrate` → `eos_core.roles.ensure_roles`; all 13 standard DocTypes carry a DocPerm block for
each of them alongside `System Manager`; and `eos_core/permissions.py` (wired via
`permission_query_conditions` + `has_permission` in `hooks.py`) confines `Manager`, `Team Member` and
`Observer` to the teams where they hold a `Player` seat, while `Owner`, `Admin` and `Coach` are
company-wide. The full model, the per-DocType grant table, and the four guards a DocPerm cannot
express are in `docs/architecture.md` §3h.

**Scope comes from `Player`, not a Frappe User Permission.** A user's teams are the `Player` rows
where `user` matches. A `User Permission` on `Team` would be wrong twice over: it stores a single
link value per user per DocType, and Ninety users can belong to several teams, and it would be a
second competing source of truth for what `validate_owner_team` already resolves.

**Measurable ownership is `owner_user`.** `EOS Metric.owner_user` is the business owner — declared,
`Link → User`, freely reassignable. `EOS Metric.owner` is Frappe's immutable document creator and is
**not** declared as a field; the column still exists because it is in `frappe.db.DEFAULT_COLUMNS`.
Keep the two apart: `owner_user` is what `validate_owner_team`, `validate_content_owner` and
`validate_content_deletion` read, and what the report snapshot and the rollup view show.
`EOSMetric.before_insert` defaults `owner_user` to the session user, which is what Frappe used to do
to `owner` implicitly. `Scorecard Report Metric` was renamed the same way for the same reason.
`eos_core/patches/backfill_measurable_owner` backfills it on migrate. Full rationale in
`docs/architecture.md` §3h.

**Known gaps.** None in Block A (`DATA-3` closed 2026-10-08). `Rock`, `Issue`, and `To Do` carry `archived` fields (`Check`, `default: 0`) with whitelisted `archive()` and `restore()` controller methods enforcing `write` permissions. Everything else in the roles article matches the grants in the DB, row for row (`PERM-12`, closed 2026-09-29, `676fde8`). Do not "simplify" that by deleting the guard in `EOSMetric.on_trash`: Ninety scopes Measurable removal to the KPIs the user owns, so a bare `delete` DocPerm row over-grants.

**A DocPerm cannot scope a role to *some* teams.** That is why `eos_core/permissions.py` exists, and
it is the thing to remember before touching any grant: adding a flat role to a DocType without the
scoping layer in `hooks.py` makes every team's data company-wide to that role — the opposite of
Ninety's assigned-teams model. Both halves are in place, so edit them together.

**There is no UI.** `public/js` and `public/css` are empty, there are no client scripts, and only
four `@frappe.whitelist()` methods (`rock.mark_complete`, `rock.get_rock_summary`,
`scorecard_report.send_report`, `scorecard.get_rollup_view`). Everything is reachable only via the
default Frappe form or the console. Treat "DONE" in the table above as "the code exists and is unit-tested", not "the
feature is reachable by a user".

**Read `docs/roadmap.md` § "Known gaps in Phases 1–5" before starting any phase.** It separates
bugs that are *fixed* from those *still open* (none), lists code that exists but has no call
site, and records that the database holds only test residue — nothing has been exercised
end-to-end by a user.

## Working conventions

- DocType layout: `doctype/<scrubbed_name>/<scrubbed_name>.json` + `.py` + `__init__.py`
  (Frappe v16 — matches the `resolv` app in this bench; no `*_doctype` suffix).
- JSON schemas: follow the format of existing files (fields array, `field_order`,
  `naming_rule: "By fieldname"`, System Manager permission block, module `"Eos Core"`).
- Child DocTypes: `"istable": 1`, empty `permissions`.
- Business logic: keep pure logic in `scorecard_engine.py` (importable, no frappe imports), and use
  thin DocType controller methods for frappe glue (DB, sessions, events).
- Don't commit unless explicitly asked.

## Gotchas that have already cost time

- **`Float` and `Int` columns are `NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`.** Frappe maps `Float` to
  `decimal(21,9) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.000000000`, so a reload gives you `0.0` and you **cannot**
  distinguish "unset" from "explicitly zero" by value alone. This codebase treats `0` as unset —
  see `compute_status`, which returns `"On Track"` when `target_value == 0`. It is a real bug source:
  it made `validate_range_target` throw on *every* re-save of a non-range metric, because
  `0 is not None`. Consequence: a legitimate range bound of exactly `0` cannot be expressed today.
  `Measurable Group.order` has the same trap, where `0` means "unset", not "first".
- **Never compare a `doc.field` to a DB value during `before_insert`.** Frappe has not cast the
  attribute yet, so `self.week_start_date` is still a `str` while `frappe.get_all` returns a
  `datetime.date` → `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'datetime.date' and 'str'`.
  Pass it to the engine's `_as_date`-backed helpers instead of comparing raw. Both the Scorecard
  Report and the L10 Scorecard Review rely on this.
- **Seeding a metric in a test requires a `Player` in that team** for the `owner_user`, or
  `EOSMetric.validate_owner_team` throws *"Owner ... has no Player record in team ..."*. Passing
  `owner_user` explicitly is optional on insert — `before_insert` defaults it to the session user.
- **`owner` is never a business field.** It is Frappe's immutable creator column and it is present on
  every DocType whether or not the JSON declares it (`frappe.db.DEFAULT_COLUMNS`), so the schema sync
  will not drop it and the error you get from touching it is `CannotChangeConstantError`, not a
  validation message about ownership. Use `owner_user` on `EOS Metric`, `Rock`, `Issue`, `To Do` and
  `Scorecard Report Metric`.
- **Write tests date-independently.** Always pass explicit dates or an explicit `as_of`; never let
  a test depend on `date.today()`. `test_rock` had a latent time bomb that would only have failed
  from 2026-10-15. Week start dates are Mondays (`2026-08-17`, `2026-08-24`, …), and the status
  indicator's grid is Monday-aligned, so a non-Monday entry never matches an interval and is
  deliberately counted as a gap.
- `tabSingles` occasionally raises `MySQLdb.OperationalError (1020, "Record has changed since last
  read")` during test-env setup. It is infrastructure flakiness, not app code — re-run before
  investigating.
- **A failing test after a behaviour change is not automatically a wrong test.** Check whether the
  test encoded the *old* rule before editing the assertion, and say so explicitly when the test was
  the thing that was wrong.
- `Measurable Group` display names are only unique *per Scorecard*, so key any group lookup by the
  group's hash `name`, never by `group_name`.
- **`unique: 1` is a single-column `Check` on a `DocField`**, valid only for `Data`, `Link` and
  `Read Only` fieldtypes (`frappe/core/doctype/doctype/doctype.py:1460-1484`). There is **no composite
  unique flag**, so a `team` × `timeframe` or `team` × `week_start_date` identity cannot be expressed
  in a `*.json` and has to come from a patch. Worse, marking a `team` column unique outright is wrong:
  a team legitimately holds four `Scorecard` rows, one per timeframe, and eight weekly `Scorecard
  Report` rows before the month rolls over. This is `DEBT-7`; knowing it before you try is cheaper.
- **`autoname: "field:<name>"` silently sets `unique: 1` on that field** during DocType validation
  (`frappe/core/doctype/doctype/doctype.py:1125-1136`). So `EOS Metric.metric_name`,
  `Issue.issue_name`, `Team.team_name`, `Player.player_name` and `Organization.organization_name` are
  already uniquely indexed whether or not their JSON says so — a `grep` for `unique` in the JSON
  under-reports.

## What the product owner expects in how you work

- The owner is a developer, **not an EOS domain expert**. They care about what actually works, and the
  roadmap previously hid the difference between "code written" and "feature usable". Keep
  reporting that distinction honestly; never let documentation overstate completion.
- They value **verified** claims. Prefer running the code, querying the DB, or fetching the real
  Ninety docs over asserting from memory, and flag anything you could not verify.
- Plain answers with a verdict beat hedged ones. Tables work well for comparison and prioritisation.
- Keep responses concise.

## What to build next

**`docs/TODO.md` is the only live work queue.** Read it before you start and before you finish.
`docs/execution/<TODO-ID>.md` is the plan for the item you picked, if it has one.

The **code** for Phases 1–5 exists and is tested, but that is not the same as usable — see the
`code+tests` / `reachable` distinction in `docs/TODO.md` § Rules. As of 2026-09-29: **Block B is
complete** — `PERM-1`, `PERM-2`, `PERM-6`, `PERM-7`, `PERM-8`, `PERM-9`, `PERM-10`, `PERM-11`,
`PERM-12` all done. **1 open data gap** (`DATA-3` — `Rock`, `Issue` and `To Do` have no `archived`
field). `PERM-3` / `PERM-4` / `PERM-5` are open but **UI-blocked**, not permission-blocked. No UI at
all.

**Block C is the largest gap and `UI-1` is its spine.** `eos_core/public/js` and
`eos_core/public/css` are empty directories, `hooks.py` sets no `doctype_js` and no `app_include_js`,
and Frappe v16 has no Worksheet Page — the scaffold's `eos_core/templates/pages/` is empty. Four
endpoints are whitelisted and nothing in the UI calls them.

**`docs/execution/` now holds a plan for every item that is too large for one context window.** Where
a plan exists, follow it; where one does not, the item is small enough to do straight from its
`TODO.md` text. `docs/execution/README.md` is the index and states the task-sizing and splitting
rules.

Do not reconstruct the work queue from `docs/roadmap.md` or from this file. Both used to carry their
own copies of the outstanding items, they drifted apart, and that is why the previous setup kept
producing duplicate and stale todos. `roadmap.md` is the phase *history*; `architecture.md` is the
*model*; `TODO.md` is the *tasks*; `docs/execution/` is the *decomposition*.

Re-read `docs/roadmap.md` and `docs/architecture.md` before starting so naming and data flow stay
consistent, and keep every behavioural decision grounded in Ninety's documented behaviour rather
than assumption.
